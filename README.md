# Bijoy to Unicode

If you need to work in a project where you need to handle text written with Bijoy, you'll have to suffer a lot(I felt the pain). In most cases, conversion from Bijoy to Unicode is an obvious requirement.

Many programmers have already solved this problem by writing a converter application. My aim is to bring them together in a single repository so that anyone don't need to reinvent the wheel.

The goal of this project is to contain Bijoy to Unicode converter for all programming languages. Right now it contains converter for Java and PHP only.

If you are interested to contribute, please come forward.
